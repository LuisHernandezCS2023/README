  Some personal projects I worked on was a chatbot coded in Python that is able to have an interesting and fun conversation with the user. Another one is a simple but fun tic-tac-toe game in C++. I will be starting my fourth of
undergraduate at UIC this 2024 fall semester. I major in computer science because I like solving problems in unique ways, as well as creating intriguing programs. I can code in python, C/C++, and Java. Some hobbies of mine are lifting and
playing Fortnite with my high school buddies. Feel free to reach out to me at any time! 😊
